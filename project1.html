                    34 of which are open to public. These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13-29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1-12)
                    and 5 Jain (caves 30-34) caves. Each group represents deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st
                    millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion. They were built close to one
                    another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India. Because of their
                    exceptional achitecture and testimony to the mixing of cultures and religions in ancient India, the
                    Ellora Caves were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983.<br>

                    known as Agra's Red Fort. Built by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1565 and completed in 1573, it served
                    as the main
                    residence of the rulers of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to
                    Delhi. It was also known as the "Lal-Qila" or "Qila-i-Akbari". Before capture by the British, the
                    last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a
                    UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during the Mughal Dynasty.[2] It is about 2.5
                    km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately
                    described as a walled city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan.<br>

                    Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a
